## Appendix A: Framework Consideration
### Current Decision
The project will continue using React for frontend development instead of migrating to Flutter, based on the following considerations:

#### Reasons for Staying with React
1. **Project Priority**: Focus on core functionality and bug fixes
2. **Web-First Approach**: React's maturity in web applications
3. **Resource Availability**: Extensive libraries and community support
4. **Time Efficiency**: Immediate feature implementation capability

#### Future Mobile Development Options
1. Maintain React web app with separate Flutter mobile app
2. Consider React Native for mobile development
3. Re-evaluate Flutter web when more mature
